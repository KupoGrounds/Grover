# Casino Mobile Game App Prize Mechanic
A common bonus round in many slot/casino styled games is a Pick Bonus. This type of “mini-
game” allows the player to pick from a finite number of objects that will each have the
possibility of awarding a varying amount of money. The player continues to pick until a
“Pooper” is selected, which in this case is an empty chest, and that would end the bonus round
(and the turn in this case). This is a simple rendition of this mechanic. This project was created
for a technical interview for a mobile game company.
